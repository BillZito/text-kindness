# Nudge (aka text-kindness)

Welcome to Nudge, on-demand reminders that you can do whatever you set your mind to! 

Coded in python and integrated with Twilio and Heroku, this app allows you to text a number and receive messages you've identified as being particularly motivational for you. 

Text-kind.py is the code for responding to incoming messages based on the person, using each individual's .txt file. 

Manage.py is the code for sending daily pump-up reminders at 10:00am in conjunction with Heroku scheduler.

Future features: 
Differentiated responses based on what you text
Power-hours with pump-up messages every five minutes when you need to be most productive

Deployed to Heorku at: 
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/nameless-garden-2811/deploy/heroku-git

There are currently 10 users, who have provided feedback on which features they like, helping me identify which types of messages were most motivational and how many messages people want to recieve at once.
