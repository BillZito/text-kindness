Bill: You're one of the 3-4 people at williams that I think pushes themselves to be fully engaged in their work and making the world a better place. You were the critical piece to our independent study, as you were to kinetic chairing-- stepping up when others stepped down, making critical decisions, and keeping an upbeat attitude when others felt down. I've never felt strife co-leading things with you, which I can tell you is not something I say lightly/ feel about almost all the other people I've led things with. Your work ethic is inspiring and I hope (and know) that we'll be working on projects together in the near future. I look forward to it! You're a light for others and you add to their lives even when you don't see it. You've already done incredible things and the world is your oyster
