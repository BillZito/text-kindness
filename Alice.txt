I can make people laugh
I can make myself laugh
I'm hot as shit
I have the strongest legs on the water polo team
I've won like 2-3 arguments with Uncle Dave
I care about people a lot and I'm good at telling people how I care about them
One time I was part of a recitation of all of School of Rock
YAAAAAS QUEEN!
Everything gets better with time!
The world is beautiful
You have amazing friends and family who love and care about you
I'm a good friend
That time I recited all of School of Rock, it was actually entertaining and enjoyable
I wrote a song that got stuck in people's heads
I look natural/ entertaining on stage
I would be good at being in the Peace Corps
"And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'"
