I love you, In the way two rocks sit pleasantly in a canyon, Waiting an eternity to think about moving an inch to the left or right if the wind so chooses.
I love you, As a bookworm holds his story, Finding new wonder in the world, As you write it ships to explore on.
I love you, Like a healthy heart loves its body, Beating the clock to announcing the seconds, Saying "hey, you like you deserve some more blood"
I love you, Like a brother loves his sister, Only understanding how to start describing what she's taught him, Decades after her five fingers curled around one of his.
I love you, As a dead man loves his lived past, Remembering how little he actually knew, About his own complexities.
I love you, As a purpose loves its process, Realizing that no matter how flawed the path, The path is still my everything.
I love you like a son loves his mother, Knowing that no matter how many loving tears flow down my cheeks for you, You'll always have twice as many for me, and a hug, as you hold me eternally in the light.
